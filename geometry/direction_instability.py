"""Direction instability computation and validity-conditioned variants.

Direction instability measures how much a perturbation response changes DIRECTION
as context varies. This module implements the raw form plus validity-filtered
variants that condition on toxicity, phenotype alignment, and transport stability.

All functions operate on signature matrices (n_contexts, n_features).
